                        <br>I love programming and I am doing it since I was 14 years old.
                        <br>I have always loved learning new things related to this certain field and teaching others about it too. <br>
                        <br>I've worked multiple projects in SA:MP Community and as a freelancher too.<br>
                        SA-MP is a multiplayer community where players play different game modes in online servers. <br>
                        I also worked on many projects in high-school to support them, made user control panels for websites for people. <br>
                        In addition, I have worked on discord bots, web scrapers, game development, and software development as well.</h3>
