        <h3>Hi, I'm Sunehildeep Singh.
        I'm an undergraduate student studying artifical intelligence.
        <br>I love programming and I am doing it since I was 14 years old.
        <br>I have always loved learning new things related to this certain field and teaching others about it too. <br>
        <br>I've worked multiple projects in SA:MP Community and as a freelancher too.<br>
        SA-MP is a multiplayer community where players play different game modes in online servers. <br>
        I also worked on many projects in high-school to support them, made user control panels for websites for people. <br>
        In addition, I have worked on discord bots, web scrapers, game development, and software development as well.</h3>
